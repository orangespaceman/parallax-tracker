# Parallax Tracker

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Two experiments with parallax animation of CSS layers, based on tracking - one with `getUserMedia` and face detection, the other using a mobile device's accelerometer.

The two experiments are based on the same concept, scrolling layers of content depending on where the detected face is located, or how the device is oriented.


## Dependencies

There are no dependencies to install, everything needed to run the experiment is stored locally.

The following external libraries have been used:

- [Face API](https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/) - for face detection

The pictures were generated by Chatty Jeeps.


## Demos

The two web pages (face and accel) need to be run through a web server in order to access the webcam.

To fire up a simple webserver on macOS, run the following command from the relevant directory:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Demos are available here:
